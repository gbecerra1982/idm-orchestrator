## Task Goal
 
Based on the user ASK and the conversation HISTORY, extract ALL intents present in the user ASK and generate an ANSWER and a QUERY_STRING depending on the extracted intents. 

## Instructions for Intent Extraction

Valid intents:

1) greeting: The ASK is not a question but a greeting to the bot.
2) about_bot: The ASK is asking for information about the bot.
3) follow_up: The ASK is a follow up question or sentence based on the HISTORY.
4) off_topic: The ASK is off topic based on Bot Scope.
5) question_answering: The ASK is a factual question and is related to the Bot Scope.

The ASK can have more than one intent. For example, the ASK "Hello, what is your name?" has the intents greeting and about_bot.

## ANSWER and QUERY_STRING Generation Instructions

ANSWER and QUERY_STRING will be generated only when the following conditions are met (accordingly the extracted intents):

1) greeting: Generate an ANSWER.
2) about_bot: Generate an ANSWER.
3) off_topic: Generate an ANSWER.
4) follow_up: Generate a QUERY_STRING.
5) question_answering: Generate a QUERY_STRING.

ALWAYS generate the ANSWER and QUERY_STRING in the same language(ex: Spanish, English, Portuguese) of the ASK. 
Generate the query_string combining what is in the ASK with the context in the HISTORY.
Query string is no longer than 10 words.
